# Data Structure and Algorithms
**This is my data structure and algorithms porfolio (mostly with Python)**

The aim of this potfolio is to study and organize knowledge about data structure and algorithms with python mainly in preparation of technical interview.
I'm certain that the continuous accumulation of knowledge sets will pay off. 

## Structure of this repository

As of now, the repository contains 3 main directories: [**Bookmarks**](bookmarks), [**Data Structures**](data_structures) and [**Algorithms**](algorithms).

### Data Structures
Questions and exercises for each data structure category with its sub-directory

1. [Array](data_structures/array)
2. [Dictionary]()
3. [Binary Search Tree](data_structures/bst)
4. [Linked List](data_structures/linked_list)
5. [Stack](data_structures/stack)
6. [Graphs](data_structures/graphs)
7. [Circular Linked List](data_structures/circular_linked_list)
8. [Doubly Linked List](data_structures/doubly_linked_list)

### Algorithms

This directories contain most frequetly encountered types of algorithm in techincal interviews

1. [Dynamic Programming](algorithms/dynamic_programming)
2. [Graphs](algorithms/graph)
3. [Greedy](algorithms/greedy)
4. [Math](algorithms/math)
5. [Misc](algorithms/miscellaneous)
6. [Sorting](algorithms/sorting)
7. [Bit Manipulation](algorithms/bit_manipulation)

## Things need to be done

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

1. Queue questions
2. Algorithms
3. More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, trees, heaps and hash.
